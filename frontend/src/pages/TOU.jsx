        <h2>Our Services</h2>
        <p>
          The information provided when using the Services is not intended for
          distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or
          country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or
          regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement
          within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who
          choose to access the Services from other locations do so on their own
          initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws,
          if and to the extent local laws are applicable.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Services are not tailored to comply with industry-specific
          regulations (e.g., Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
          Act (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA),
          etc.). If your interactions would be subjected to such laws, you may
          not use the Services.
        </p>

        <p>
          You may not use the Services in a way that would violate the
          Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).

          Property Rights will constitute a material breach of our Legal Terms
          and your right to use our Services will terminate immediately.
